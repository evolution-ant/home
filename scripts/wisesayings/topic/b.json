In a two-part episode, the show’s protagonist, a bell-bottomed cyborg secret agent named Steve Austin, fought a scraggly-looking, cave-dwelling Sasquatch (played by the seven-foot-four-inch-tall wrestler André the Giant). That bearded, white-eyed, feral beast, who turned out to be a robot created by space aliens, and whose image, I’m certain, bore into the consciousness of millions of young people like me, derived its spellbinding horror from the fact that it looked and acted more like a human than an ape.

Did it compete with humans for food, water and habitat? It can be postulated that due to its size and/or relative appearance to man and his primeval behavior that the two species simply could not coexist.

The data is inconclusive as to whether these two types of people have actually seen Bigfoot more often than other types; it just might be that they are more apt to report it. These two types of people are mushroom pickers, and cannabis enthusiasts.

You would never think of calling a logger a 'brush ape,' to their face anyway so why is it okay to call the Sasquatch People 'swamp monsters'?

It reminded me of when I'd stopped going to school and the weird uneasy feeling I'd gotten afterward, like I was forgetting to do something. My life until that point had pivoted around some form of education, and all of a sudden, it was gone. Homework, classes, running around, and then 'bam' nothing but a life of work stretching out before you. No one prepares you for that feeling or even mentions it. You just suddenly have a gap and have to decide how to fill it. A break up is like that gap, only much, much more painful. One day the person you talked to constantly or did stuff with is just absent. Gone. Poof. And even though I'm not one of those people who has to be in a relationship all the time, I was feeling at a loss.",

In the absence of any traceable etymology, contemporary observers turned to various origin myths, each more imaginative than the other. Some believed the Latin homo bonus ('good man') to be the root. Others privileged the familiar salutation 'Ho, boy!' or the descriptive 'hoc-boy.' Searching further afield, a creative few, such as William Aspinwall, argued that 'hobo' was an anglicized version of foreign phrases like 'Haut Beau.'",
