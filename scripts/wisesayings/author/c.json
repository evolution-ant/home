            "For some people, 'the point of no return' begins at the very moment their souls become aware of each others' existence.",
            "I think that fame removes true happiness. Because when you are famous, people know you for who they think you are and when you are happy, it's because people have met you and see you for who you really are.

            "We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved.",

            "Lots of things can be fixed. Things can be fixed. But many times, relationships between people cannot be fixed, because they should not be fixed.

            "Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you. In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn’t have the time to sit around and talk about you. What’s important to me is not others’ opinions of me, but what’s important to me is my opinion of myself.",
            "I think that the best thing we can do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway...let them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.",

You have to forgive yourself, every day, whenever you remember a shortcoming, a flaw, you have to tell yourself 'That's just fine.' You have to forgive yourself so much until you don't even see those things anymore. Because that's what love is like.",
            "Elegance is a glowing inner peace. Grace is an ability to give as well as to receive and be thankful. Mystery is a hidden laugh always ready to surface!

            "We are united by the reality that all colors and all cultures are distinct and individual. ",
            "We lie if we say we do not see color and culture and difference. We should not want to be the same as others, and we should not want others to be the same as us... Rather, we ought to glory and shine in all of our differences, flaunting them fabulously for all to see! It is never conformity that we need! What we need is to burst out into all these beautiful colors!",
            "I think that the best thing we can do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway... let them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.",
            "You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.",
            "I find it odd- the greed of mankind. People only like you for as long as they perceive they can get what they want from you. Or for as long as they perceive you are who they want you to be. But I like people for all of their changing surprises, the thoughts in their heads, the warmth that changes to cold and the cold that changes to warmth... for being human. The rawness of being human delights me.",

In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my opinion of myself.",

            "Men have two greatest fears: the first fear is the fear of being needed, and the second fear is the fear of not being needed.",
            "A lifetime isn't forever, so take the first chance, don't wait for the second one! Because sometimes, there aren't second chances! And if it turns out to be a mistake? So what! This is life! A whole bunch of mistakes! But if you never get a second chance ",

            "Ends are not bad things, they just mean that something else is about to begin. And there are many things that don't really end, anyway, they just begin again in a new way. Ends are not bad and many ends aren't really an ending; some things are never-ending.",

            "A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful.

            "Just because something isn't a lie does not mean that it isn't deceptive. A liar knows that he is a liar, but one who speaks mere portions of truth in order to deceive is a craftsman of destruction.",

            "Most men either compromise or drop their greatest talents and start running after, what they perceive to be, a more reasonable success, and somewhere in between they end up with a discontented settlement. Safety is indeed stability, but it is not progression.",

            "A solid answer to everything is not necessary. Blurry concepts influence one to focus, but postulated clarity influences arrogance.",

            "Rather than swallowing our pride and simply asking what we do not know, we choose to fill in the blanks ourselves and later become humbled. Wisdom was often, in its youth, proven foolish, and ones humiliated were meant to become wise.",

            "Law without reason is criminal.",

            "Quiet people always know more than they seem. Although very normal, their inner world is by default fronted mysterious and therefore assumed weird.

            "When a man has a gift in speaking the truth, brute aggression is no longer his security blanket for approval. He, on the contrary, spends most of his energy trying to tone it down because his very nature is already offensive enough.",
            "Companionship is a foreign concept to some people. They fear it as much as the majority of people fear loneliness.",
            "We are often taught to look for the beauty in all things, so in finding it, the layman asks the philosopher while the philosopher asks the photographer.",
            "If the entire world sought to make itself worthy of happiness rather than make itself happy, then the entire world would be happy.",
            "I will never deny that life isn't fair. It seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent, but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk.",

            "If you build the guts to do something, anything, then you better save enough to face the consequences",
            "To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect.",
            "Never hide things from hardcore thinkers. They get more aggravated, more provoked by confusion than the most painful truths.",
            "Excitement is a crossroad which runs in all directions. No man lacks personality; he just never connected with you at the intersection.",

            "Ask anyone and they'll most likely say their family is crazy, and if they don't say their family is crazy, their friends are crazy. That's because everyone is crazy after taking the mask off. People are most themselves when not really trying to fit in, when either alone or around those already closest to them, and that is crazy.",
            "The height of cleverness is in one's ability to be very clever without seeming clever at all.",
            "Beware: open-mindedness will often say, 'Everything is permissible except a sharp opinion.",
