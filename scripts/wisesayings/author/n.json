            "Criticism and literature are related as a theory to practice, and the function of criticism is to explain the social function and relevance of literature.",
            "Literature, we said, is conscious mythology; it creates an autonomous world that gives us an imaginative perspective on the actual one.",
            "Literature is the total body of stories and symbols that provides hypotheses or models of human behavior and experience.",
            "Consciousness is a magician who controls the demon of will.",
            "I use the term epiphany to mean the opposite of sparagmos.",
            "Literature is not a subject of study, but an object of study; the fact that it consists of words, as we have seen, makes us confuse it with the talking verbal disciplines.",
            "The child beginning geometry is presented with a dot and it is told, first, that that is a pointer, and second, that it is not a point. He cannot advance until he accepts both statements at once.",
            "In an immature society culture is an import; for a mature one it is a native manufacture which eventually becomes an export.",
            "A teacher who is not a scholar is soon to be going out of touch with his own subject, and a scholar who is not a teacher is soon going to be out of touch with the world.",
            "To increase consciousness is to increase mobility by metaphor.",
            "There doesn't seem to be a recognized yoga of art, not that it matters, for there is one anyway, and I don't have to pretend to myself, as I should to students, that I know what it means. Suppose I call it Sutra-Yoga. Sutra, like strophe & verse, means the turn, the vortical twist of the mind in the imagined form.",
            "It is in the imagination that the world becomes more intelligible, and communication proceeds without the obstacles of cultural difference.",
            "We have manic people talking about the Age of Aquarius, where everything is just going to be wonderful, and then we have depressive people talking about atomic bombs and the destruction of civilization. ",
            "Yoga is the voluntary suppression of the involuntary actions of the mind. We're all born with a natural yoga: we're freed by objective energy and our consciousness freezes it into matter. ",

            "The world of waking consciousness represents for the creative imagination, a low level of reality.",

            "Literature is founded on the metaphor that arrests logic and the myth that arrests history; its works are objects of contemplation.",
            "Literature is conscious mythology: as society develops, its mythical stories become structural principles of story-telling, its mythical concepts, sun-gods, and the like, become habits of metaphoric thought. In a fully mature literary tradition, the writer enters into a structure of traditional stories and images.",

            "I think the real longing is not for a mass movement sweeping up individual concerns, but for an individualized movement reaching out to social concerns.",

            "The \"yoga\" intuition is founded on the notion of transforming the body, & I don't know if there's any Christian alternative answer to it. Our present body is almost wholly unknown to the consciousness which inhabits it. Yoga creates an imaginative body in its place, & goes to work on that. ",
            "Science fiction frequently tries to imagine what life would be like on a plane as far above us as we are above savagery; its setting is often of a kind that appears to us as technologically miraculous. It is thus a mode of romance with a strong inherent tendency to myth.",

            "In adolescence particularly there are strong pressures toward introversion on the one hand, and rigid conformity to group action on the other. Both of these, as we saw in the hippie movement of a few years ago, tend to make a fetish of inarticulateness. ",

            "Criticism is the science of literature: a systematic and progressive comprehension of it.",
            "The conception pi does not mean anything except another mathematical formulation of it.

            "If any literary work is emotionally 'depressing,' there is something wrong with either the writing or the reader's response.",

            "We have criticism simply because the directed experience of literature is never adequate.",

            "I say that I was impressed, because, at the age of seventeen, I was not easy to impress. I knew the answers to a great many more questions than I know now.",
            "Of course, a scholar who attempts anything but scholarship is rather in the position of a man who has volunteered to amuse a children's party; he is not sure that his really solid virtues will count for much.",
            "There are two kinds of illusion, the negative illusion which merely fails to be a reality, and the illusion which exists as a potentiality or model in the mind, as a fiction which does not yet exist but may be brought into existence or realized by a creative mind. ",

            "Literature is at the center of those because literature is the great laboratory of myths, that is, the statement of reality in terms of man's hopes and desires and fears.",
            "The ups and downs of this cosmos may sometimes be acknowledged to be metaphorical ups and downs, but until about Newton's time most people took the \"up\" of heaven and the \"down\" of hell to be more or less descriptive.",
            "Every scholar develops something analogous to a sense of smell, and if a book has declared itself intellectually bankrupt on page 2 the experienced scholar, left to himself will not read on to page 302.",
            "Science fiction may conceivably be a primitive beginning of a new form of heroic epic; Beckett and similar types of literary nihilism the primitive beginnings of a new antithetical pessimism. ",

            "The whole notion of 'productive' is an assembly-line notion that is now being outgrown. A scholar should take a creative interest in his subject, and what will make the 'productive' compulsion less universal will be the rise in adult education.",
            "Every human society possesses a mythology which is inherited, transmitted and diversified by literature. ",
            "Literature is an art of words, and the student of it may be interested primarily either in the art or in the words.",

            "Certainly, the influence of my teachers on me was not directly through anything they taught me, but the impression they gave that the life of a scholar was worth living.",
            "In science fiction, it's the world within that's really existing, and the world without is only a projection of it. At least, when the within isn't interesting, the without isn't either.",
            "I think the only government of which the human race is capable is more or less efficient or corrupt bureaucracy. The degrees of efficiency and corruption are what make the difference.",
            "When all the intelligence, morality, reverence, and simian cunning of man confronts a sphinx-like riddle of the indefinite like the Canadian winter, the man seems as helpless as a trapped mink and as lonely as a loon.",

            "There is no such thing as inherent or built-in relevance; no subject is relevant in itself, because every field of knowledge is equally the centre of all knowledge.",
            "Restoration is an often disastrous solution: tourists in English cathedrals hear a good deal about the vandalism of Cromwell's soldiers, but the devastation wrought by Victorian restorers has been often far worse, however much better the motive.",
            "Culture is born in leisure and an awareness of standards, and pioneer conditions tend to make energetic and uncritical work an end it itself, to preach a gospel of social unconsciousness, which lingers long after the pioneer conditions have disappeared.",
            "The difference between non-objective and abstract painting may be suggested by the difference between mathematics and music.",
            "The reason why detectives in detective stories are so preternaturally intelligent is that they're angels. Guardian angels of society; avenging angels for the murder. Everyone is guilty of something, so all the major character are suspects. ",
            "For many people the hippie movement is something to drop into and out of.",
            "The disinterested imaginative core of mythology is what develops into literature, science, philosophy. Religion is applied to mythology.",
            "Revolutions are started, though they are seldom finished, by people of conviction. Nothing is more tedious than other people's convictions and the most natural response to tedium is apathy.",
            "The mystic finds, at the heart of the illusion of space, a real presence."
